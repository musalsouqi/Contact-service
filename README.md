# Contact-service

Ensuring Functionality and Security
To ensure that my code is both functional and secure, I implement unit testing and enforced validation rules. Unit tests verify that individual components work correctly, while boundary and exception testing ensure robustness against edge cases and invalid inputs. Security measures include preventing unauthorized modifications, such as making contact IDs immutable and enforcing constraints on data input to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

Interpreting User Needs and Incorporating Them into a Program
Understanding user needs requires analyzing requirements and translating them into clear, testable functionality. In this project, I ensured that contact, task, and appointment services adhered to specified constraints, such as enforcing unique contact IDs and preventing invalid appointment dates. By aligning test cases with requirements, I validated that the software met user expectations.

Software Design Approach
My approach to designing software starts with defining the core functionality and identifying constraints. I then create modular, testable components that encapsulate specific behaviors, ensuring maintainability and scalability. By integrating unit testing early, I verify that each component operates correctly before they interact as a whole. This iterative process helps refine the software and ensures alignment with project goals.
